          I'm a student from Czechia with a love for all things tech and active!
          I enjoy creating websites, developing Android apps, and flying FPV
          drones. Photography is another passion of mine, capturing moments that
          tell a story. When I'm not behind a screen, you'll find me staying
          active with sports and hitting the gym. Fitness is a big part of my
          life, keeping me energized and focused.

          Feel free to reach out via email, and check out some of my projects on
          GitHub. I'm always excited to connect and collaborate with like-minded
          individuals.
