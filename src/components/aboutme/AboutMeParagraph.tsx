        I'm a student from Czechia with a love for all things tech and active! I
        enjoy creating websites, developing Android apps, and flying FPV drones.
        Photography is another passion of mine, capturing moments that tell a
        story. When I'm not behind a screen, you'll find me staying active with
        sports and hitting the gym. Fitness is a big part of my life, keeping me
        energized and focused.

        Feel free to reach out via email, and check out some of my projects on
        GitHub. I'm always excited to connect and collaborate with like-minded
        individuals.
        <br />
        Take care, Dominik Bartu≈°ka
